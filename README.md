## üéØ Prediction Algorithm

The prediction system uses a weighted algorithm that considers:

### Factors and Weights
- **Player Rankings** (15%): Current ATP rankings
- **Head-to-Head Records** (20%): Historical performance against opponent
- **Surface Performance** (15%): Win rates on specific surfaces
- **Recent Form** (15%): Recent match performance
- **Live Statistics** (25%): Current match statistics
- **Match Momentum** (10%): Current match flow and score

### Prediction Types
1. **Match Winner**: Overall match outcome prediction
2. **Game Winner**: Current game prediction (focuses on serving and immediate momentum)
3. **Set Winner**: Current set prediction (considers set score and match momentum)

## üé® User Interface

### Dashboard Features
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live match count, prediction accuracy, player rankings
- **Live Matches**: Current matches with real-time scores and statistics
- **Top Players**: Ranked list of top players with performance metrics
